*** Matlab code reproduction of Selesnick and Al-Alaoui digital differentiators ***
The realized Matlab code realizes the function of the Maximally flat Low-pass Digital Differentiators
developed by Ivan Selesnick and the Linear Phase Low-Pass IIR Digital Differentiators of Al-Alaoui.
Those filters are described in two different scientific papers, and the purpose was to simulate 
the results which can be obtained practically implementing the procedures described by the authors.



Contents of the project: 
- generalities of the Maximally flat Low-pass Digital Differentiator 
- transfer function and frequency response of the Maximally flat Low-pass Digital Differentiator 
- the relation between characteristic constants and bandwidth
- testing and study of the maximum error bandwidth related
- generalities of Low-Pass IIR Digital Differentiator (type I and type II)
- low pass filter applied to differentiator output
- comparison among the differentiators 
- frequency response, stopband, bandpass and group delay
